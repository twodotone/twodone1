        "Simple Model Toggle": "Checkbox to enable/disable simple model comparison",
        "Model Type": "Choice between Fixed Window (3-year) and Dynamic Season weighting",
        "Description": "Users can choose to see just standard model or both models"
    },
    
    "Display Layout": {
        "Two-Tab Interface": "Model Overview tab for quick comparison, Detailed Analysis for deep dive",
        "Agreement Indicators": "Visual color-coded indicators showing model consensus",
        "Side-by-Side Metrics": "Vegas line, Standard model, Simple model, and difference all visible",
        "Description": "Clean, organized comparison without overwhelming the user"
    },
    
    "Model Agreement System": {
        "Green (≤2 pts)": "Models closely agree - high confidence",
        "Yellow (2-5 pts)": "Moderate disagreement - some uncertainty", 
        "Red (>5 pts)": "Strong disagreement - high uncertainty",
        "Description": "Color-coded confidence based on how much models agree"

print("✅ Successfully integrated Simple Model into existing app.py framework")
print("✅ Users can now see both Standard and Simple model predictions")
print("✅ Visual indicators show when models agree/disagree")
print("✅ Confidence analysis based on model consensus")
print("✅ Option for Dynamic Season weighting")

print("\n📊 HOW IT WORKS:")
print("1. Enable 'Show Simple Model' in sidebar")
print("2. Choose Fixed Window or Dynamic Season weighting")
print("3. Select a game to see both predictions side-by-side")
print("4. Green = models agree (high confidence)")
print("5. Yellow = moderate disagreement (some uncertainty)")  
print("6. Red = strong disagreement (high uncertainty)")

print("\n🎯 BENEFITS:")
print("• Identifies uncertain predictions when models disagree")
print("• Shows impact of SOS adjustments and dynamic HFA")
print("• Transparent methodology comparison")
print("• Helps users understand model limitations")
print("• Provides confidence levels for decision making")
