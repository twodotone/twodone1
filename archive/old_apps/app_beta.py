    ### Core Model (Version 1.0)
    
    This NFL prediction model uses Expected Points Added (EPA) with several key enhancements:
    
    - **Multi-Year Historical Weighting**: Uses data from 2023-2025 with declining weights (50/30/20)
    - **Recency Boost**: Applies 30% extra weight to the most recent 8 games
    - **Dynamic Team-Specific HFA**: Calculates home field advantage individually for each team
    - **Offensive/Defensive Weighting**: Weights teams based on their offensive/defensive strengths
    - **Confidence Ratings**: 5-star system based on historical performance at various edge values
    
    ### Enhanced Variance Model (Beta)
    
    The optional enhanced variance model adds:
    
    - **Team Consistency Tracking**: Measures how consistently teams perform
    - **Matchup-Specific Variance**: Calculates expected variance for specific matchups
    - **Bayesian Credible Intervals**: Shows the range where the true spread likely falls
    - **Adjusted Confidence Thresholds**: More consistent teams get higher confidence at smaller edges
    
    This helps identify situations where a smaller edge may still be significant if it involves highly consistent teams.
