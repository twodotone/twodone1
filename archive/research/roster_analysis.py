Key Facts About NFL Roster Turnover:

1. **Average Annual Turnover**: ~30-35% of roster changes each year
2. **3-Year Turnover**: ~60-70% of players different after 3 years  
3. **Key Positions**: QB, top WRs, elite defenders tend to be more stable
4. **Coaching Stability**: Average NFL coach tenure is ~3-4 years

IMPLICATIONS FOR EPA-BASED MODELING:

✅ **3 Years is Optimal Because:**
   - Captures core team identity (stable players/coaching)
   - Includes enough data for statistical reliability (~48 games)
   - Avoids including too much "stale" personnel data
   - Aligns with typical coaching/system tenure

❌ **Why Not 4+ Years:**
   - >70% roster turnover means you're largely predicting different teams
   - Coaching system changes become more likely
   - Scheme evolution in NFL happens rapidly
   - Draft classes age out (rookie contracts end after 4 years)

❌ **Why Not 1-2 Years:**
   - Insufficient sample size for reliable EPA estimates
   - Too much noise from small samples
   - Extreme outlier games have outsized impact
   - Can't properly assess team consistency

CONCLUSION:
3 years (2022-2024) is the goldilocks zone - not too much stale data,
not too little reliable data. Your model choice is optimal.
