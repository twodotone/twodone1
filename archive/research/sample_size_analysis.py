Based on the sample size and stability analysis:

1. **Minimum Data**: Need ~24 games (1.5 seasons) for basic EPA reliability
2. **Optimal Window**: 48+ games (3 seasons) provides good stability
3. **Diminishing Returns**: Beyond 3 seasons, stability improves minimally
4. **Team Rankings**: 3-year window shows most consistent team evaluations

CONCLUSION: Stick with 3 years (2022-2024) for the following reasons:

✅ **Statistical Reliability**: ~48 games per team provides stable EPA estimates
✅ **Current Relevance**: Captures recent team compositions and systems
✅ **Balanced Approach**: Avoids both small-sample noise and stale data
✅ **Practical**: Standard industry practice for modern NFL analysis

Your intuition was correct - 3 years is the sweet spot!
